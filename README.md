## Motivation

As the population of Baltimore continues to decline, from a peak of approximately 1 million residents in 1950 to 600,000 today, the city is grappling with thousands of vacant buildings and empty parcels of land (hereafter referred to as “vacants”). Evidence shows that vacants have adverse impacts on health, neighborhood cohesion, and safety. Baltimore City has thus implemented a range of programs intended to mitigate the negative effects of vacants, encourage building stewardship, and promote economic vitality. 

**This project aims to:**
- characterize the neighborhoods that have a high portion of vacants and program activites
- analyze the intersection and overlap of four Baltimore City policies that address vacants
- visually depict these relationships through mapping software

**Adopt-A-Lot:** Enables citizens to adopt/steward designated empty plots of land for private use.
**Open-Bid:** Enables citizens to purchase certain vacant parcels. 
**Receivership:** Encompasses a suite of targeted city activities intended to preserve and sustain “middle market neighborhoods.” Consists of targeted housing code enforcement; issuance of citations for negligence; seizure of properties; and legal transfer of deed to new receiving entity.
**Demolition:** Includes city sponsored, targeted demolition of abandoned or neglected properties.
